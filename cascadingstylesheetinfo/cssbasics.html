                <h2> Color </h2>
                <p> In CSS, you can change how an element looks with the -color- tag. Primarily, this is used for changing the color of text and headers. For backgrounds of text and divisions, (background-color) is used. It is generally better to use translucent backgrounds</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Margin, Border, and Padding </h2>
                <p> Margin, border, and padding are all qualities that can help align text. Border is how far apart you want the element to be from other elements. Padding is how much space you want between the border of an element and its contents. Elements can have a border, a line around them that can change color and thickness</p>

                <h2> HTML JS and CSS Integration</h2>
                <p> JS and CSS can be integrated into an HTML file itself. The syntax for integrating a style into an element is (style=), followed by what the user wants. For JS, it is (script). Integrating these are not recommended, since they can quickly clutter text up</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Divisions </h2>
                <p> Element tags such as div (block display) and span (inline display) are used to divide up different sections of content. Tags such as p and hX cannot be used to divide up sections. A common use for dividing element tags is to create flex boxes</p>

                <h2> Fonts and Spacing </h2>
                <p> Fonts and backup fonts can be set to change how text looks, as well as backups used for incase a user's system is not able to dispay a font. "Font-Family" is used. For spacing, "Line-height", "letter-spacing", "" </p>

                <h2> Box-Shadow </h2>
                <p> Box shadow is a property in CSS which allows you to add a shadow to an element. It can be doen with the syntax of "box-shadow: " + (offset x) + (offset y) + (blur radius) + color. For multiple shadows, use a comma to seperate them</p>
