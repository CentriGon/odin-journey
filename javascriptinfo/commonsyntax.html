                <h2> Declaring Variables</h2>
                <p> Declaring variables in JavaScript is quite simple. There are only two feesible methods (var excluded), of which -let- is the most common. Additionally, there are also constants, which can be declared using -const-. Constants are to be used for vales that never change</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Operators </h2>
                <p> Operators such as (+ , - , * , /) are used for mathmatical equations. The (%) operator gives the remainder after a division calculation is complete. The (**) is what is used for exponential form, instead of Math.pow(). (++) and (--) increment</p>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Console </h2>
                <p> The console is located at the bottom of the inspect element tool, and is what commands such as (Console.log()) print to. Additionally, there is also alert, which is similar to System.out.print in java. The console log cannot be viewed from the original website</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Debugging </h2>
                <p> You can debug errors within the dev-tools feature of google chrome. This can be done by inspecting an element, and going to the sources tab, and adding backstops that pause when an action is performed</p>

                <h2> Functions</h2>
                <p> Functions are the same concept as classes in java. They can be used to perfor any action thats part of a whole. An arrow function is an unnamed function that takes the result of another function as its parameter</p>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> If, else if, and switch </h2>
                <p> If, else of, amd switch are conditionals that tell a program when to respond with a certain action as a result of an input. Switch's are basically a group of if + if else statements. Switches can be used instead becasuse it would be more neat and faster to write a switch than a group of if's.</p>
