                <h2> Declaring Variables</h2>
                <p> Declaring variables in JavaScript is quite simple. There are only two feesible methods (var excluded), of which -let- is the most common. Additionally, there are also constants, which can be declared using -const-. Constants are to be used for vales that never change</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Operators </h2>
                <p> Operators such as (+ , - , * , /) are used for mathmatical equations. The (%) operator gives the remainder after a division calculation is complete. The (**) is what is used for exponential form, instead of Math.pow(). (++) and (--) increment</p>
            </div>
        

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Console </h2>
                <p> The console is located at the bottom of the inspect element tool, and is what commands such as (Console.log()) print to. Additionally, there is also alert, which is similar to System.out.print in java. The console log cannot be viewed from the original website</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Debugging </h2>
                <p> You can debug errors within the dev-tools feature of google chrome. This can be done by inspecting an element, and going to the sources tab, and adding backstops that pause when an action is performed</p>

                <h2> Functions</h2>
                <p> Functions are the same concept as classes in java. They can be used to perfor any action thats part of a whole. An arrow function is an unnamed function that takes the result of another function as its parameter</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> If, else if, and switch </h2>
                <p> If, else of, amd switch are conditionals that tell a program when to respond with a certain action as a result of an input. Switch's are basically a group of if + if else statements. Switches can be used instead becasuse it would be more neat and faster to write a switch than a group of if's.</p>

                <h2> for ... of loops</h2>
                <p> for of loops are enhanced array loops. They can intake an array, such as cats, with five cats. Then they can, with the decleration of --for (const cats for catsVar)--, set the catsVar to the first element of the cats array, and then repeat for all elements in the cats array</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Map and Filter Arrays</h2>
                <p> The map() function, when applied to an array, produces an output that consists of all the contents of the array it maps into a certain function. E.X: animals.map(startWithL()); The filter function does pretty much the same thing, except filter takes a boolean</p>

                <h2> do . . . while loops </h2>
                <p> A do . . . while loop is very similar to a while loop. The main difference is that the "while" part of the loop comes last, meaning the program does not check if the conditions of the loop have been met until the loop has already iterated once</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> querySelector </h2>
                <p> querySelector allows JS files to access HTML elements. The syntax for them is "const div = document.querySelector(box)". Common Syntax: parentNode.appendChild(childNode. element.style.cssText="". It is better to toggle a CSS style. element = document.querySelector("div"), element.classList.toggle("style") </p>

                <h2> User Inputs </h2>
                <p> Although user input can be taken using "prompt()", the better way is either ".onclick()" or ".addEventListener()" The parameters of ".addEventListener()" shoud inclide the type "'onclock'" + a function that does something. Adding () to the function runs it even wthout a click.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "info-box1"> 
                <h2> Fonts and Spacing </h2>
                <p> Fonts and backup fonts can be set to change how text looks, as well as backups used for incase a user's system is not able to dispay a font. "Font-Family" is used. For spacing, "Line-height", "letter-spacing", "" </p>
